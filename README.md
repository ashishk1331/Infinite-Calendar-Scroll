# Infinite Scrollable Journal Calendar

An infinite-scrolling calendar built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **react-window** for smooth, virtualized week-by-week rendering. Users can view journal entries attached to dates, scroll seamlessly into the past and future, and interact with entries in a swipeable card interface.

## üéπ Technique

![Illustration explaining the calendar loadout](./technique.webp)

For this task, I wanted to experiment with virtual lists and on-demand week data generation. The image shows the intuition behind the trick I used to render (almost) infinite months on the calendar. I broke it into two parts ‚Äî let‚Äôs talk about both.

1. **Only Future**
   At first, I thought about how to generate future months. This can be done by adding subsequent weeks to the current week. (Here, the `date-fns` library helped a lot by handling edge cases for calendar days.) For example:

   ```md
   Current Week + 1 Week = Next Week
   Current Week + 2 Weeks = Second Week in the Future
   ...
   and so on.

   Broadly,
   Current Week + n Weeks = nth Week in the Future
   ```

   For a continuous calendar, we don‚Äôt need to worry about month padding. All we need to do is calculate the nth week in the future that‚Äôs requested for rendering.

   In this case, I used the `react-virtuoso` feature that returns the index of the row being rendered on the screen. We can use this index directly to calculate the week needed. This way, we can render (almost) infinite months into the future.

2. **Past as Well**
   Rendering past months was more challenging. For some reason, binary search kept coming to mind ‚Äî so I thought, why not start in the middle and expand in both directions?

   By splitting the rows into two parts, the upper part represents past weeks and the lower part represents future weeks, with the current week in the middle (see the image). We can then reuse the previous technique to calculate weeks.

   However, doing this in `react-virtuoso` was tricky, since it only counts rows from zero up to the total row count. To solve this, I chose the middle (`total_row_count / 2`) as the starting point, scrolled to it [initially](https://virtuoso.dev/initial-index/), and then computed weeks relative to it. The offset is simply `(middle - row_index)`. The sign of the offset tells us whether to add weeks (future) or subtract weeks (past).

**In conclusion:** we can treat the middle as the origin, calculate offsets on both sides, and then decide based on the sign whether to move forward (future) or backward (past).

Now, how do we calculate the active month for the header? For this, I found a handy callback prop in the `react-virtuoso` component: [`rangeChanged`](https://virtuoso.dev/range-change-callback/). It provides the `startIndex` and `endIndex` of the currently rendered range (i.e., the weeks being displayed).

I simply take the mean of these two values and use it to calculate the offset week, which in turn determines the active month and year.

And voila! ‚ú®
